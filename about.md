Hi, I'm Fred a developer currently based in Nigeria with an interest in many technological fields, I get excited by tech and have been this way for as long as I can remember. I love to build solutions that are powered by AI as I find it very intriguing how a computer by it's [defination](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer) can come up with representations of real-world objects. 

Anyways enough ranting I would write about any of my latest findings and thoughts here on my [blog](/archive/). I am also interested in many topics like Philosophy, Cosmology, Mathematics, Physics e.t.c. I never run out of interest üòÅ and I‚Äôd be sure to share all my ideas in my [blog](/archive/).

I love to read, play video games, listen to music, and watch anime, movies, and documentaries in my free time.
